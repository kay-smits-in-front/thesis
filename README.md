This repository contains modules for Physics informed neural networks, building, optimzation and reviewing.

These modules have been implemented on two datasets. One without weather data named speed_trials. The other data set with weather data, called speed_trials_weather or additional_data.

In this thesis research was done towards finding a combination of explanatory AI trough embedding physics into the loss layer in deep learning models. In this case MLP, RNN and LSTM
